Customer:	PCENGINES

========================================================================

4 MARCH 2016

Status:
* Final

Notes:
  
New features:
* Added sdcard support
* Several items related to the serial output during boot

Solved Issues:
* Includes a fix for the P state switching issue that caused the system to run at 600 Mhz.
* System hang during reboot from Linux when the speed was stuck at 600 Mhz 
 
Known Issues:
* PXE boot not available yet, waiting for PC engines
* The Setup payload is included as a binary into this tree, this is provided by PC Engines
* The Eltan Memtest payload is included as a binary into this tree, PC Engines should replace
  this with their payload
* The SGABIOS is included as a binary into this tree. Source is provided seperately and should
  be built seperately.
* As USB3 SS and HS items have seperated devices two entries per USB slot are needed
  now these are listed seperately. This is working but is not customer friendly. This
  can be solved by changing the setup payload or by changing SeaBIOS. It is suggested
  to change the setup payload.
* Larger USB3 disks using 4K sectors will not be supported as SeaBIOS doesn't support that block 
  size. 
* At this point in time the boost states are not working with the 412TC
* The sdcard performance is still subpar, more work needs to be put in SeaBIOS to improve this.

Remarks:
* The USB3 issue has be solved by providing more time for the USB enumeration. 
  Boot time might be longer because of that (depending on the situation). If this
  is a problem a setup option to set this timeout should ve added. It was required
  to change this timeout from 100 ms to 500 ms.

==============================================================================

9 NOVEMBER 2015

Status:
* Alpha 4

Notes:
  
New features:
* None

Solved Issues:
* The issue with USB3 when the SS device was plugged in the top slot has been
  solved. This has been tested with ADATA and SanDisk USB sticks.

Known Issues:
* PXE boot not available yet, waiting for PC engines
* As USB3 SS and HS items have seperated devices two entries per USB slot are needed
  now these are listed seperately. This is working but is not customer friendly. This
  can be solved by changing the setup payload or by changing SeaBIOS. It is suggested

6 NOVEMBER 2015

Status:
* Alpha 3

Notes:
  
New features:
* Enable and disable of console functionality in SeaBIOS using setup payload
  if disabled it can be turned on again by pressing the button.
* Added XHCI ports to the bootorder list for APU2B
* Memory now at 1333 Mhz
* 4G memory configuration now with enabled ECC

Solved Issues:
* Changed to AGESA 1.0.0.4.0121 and spd based on the Hynix information
* APU2B partially solves the USB2 / USB3 issue.
* The setup payload is now saving the settings

Known Issues:
* When USB3 stick is in the top slot and there is another device plugged in as
  well it will not be recognised by SeaBIOS. A single USB3 is working and USB3 in
  bottom combined with USB2 in the top slot is working as well.
* PXE boot not available yet waiting for PC engines
* As USB3 SS and HS items have seperated devices two entries per USB slot are needed
  now these are listed seperately. This is working but is not customer friendly. This
  can be solved by changing the setup payload or by changing SeaBIOS. It is suggested

28 SEPTEMBER 2015

Status:
* Alpha 2

Notes:
  
New features:
* Added Setup payload provided by PC Engines
* Created boot order list added USB1, USB2, mSATA and SATA to the list of boot items

Solved Issues:
* Enabled USB2 ports connected to USB header and mini PCIe slots
* Changed the name to PC Engines apu2

Known Issues:
* Memory not full speed
* USB3 is working but not when a USB2 device is plugged in as well. This is
  caused by the hw that swapped the USB2 and USB3 lines on the connector.
  Will be addressed in a next release of the board.
* PXE boot not available yet waiting for PC engines
* The Setup payload provided is not working properly. It returns "Could not find SPI device"
  when configuration changes are saved.

Remarks:
* None
